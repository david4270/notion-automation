# notion-automation

Welcome to the notion automation script! In order to track my life better and make it more structured, I decided to write a daily diary and tracker in Notion - as it is automatically synchronized between different devices (Android/iOS/Windows). The daily tracker is divided into three sections - to-do, tracker, and diary. While not all sections are filled and are meant to be filled automatically, it would be good if the daily tracker pages could be created with daily events populated within the tracker, if they exist.

Since Notion provides API which could be used with Python3, I decided to use notion's API to make a daily page (and a monthly page if it is a new month).
